<!--ABOUT -->

        About
      </h1>
<p>
Throughout this documentary film, we showcase the many steps and stages artists go through to achieve success in this industry. Within the five segments we feature, we have chosen artists that currently reflect one of the stages. Amber gracefully exposes what these artists go through to make it to the top- everything from long hours, impossible expectations, low/no pay, and being under excessive amounts of pressure.

Amber also brings light to the misconception of our trade as one that is for those who cannot succeed at more conventional careers and that it’s not a “real job.” Those on the outside often look at this industry as prissy girls and boys who are just looking for the glamorous aspect of the industry and do not have valuable qualities like work ethic and discipline. 
</p>
<p>
  Some aspiring artists even assume this industry is easy to break into, not knowing how much sweat equity is required, which couldn’t be farther from the truth. In reality, there are many amazing opportunities if you know where your strengths are, what you want to do within the industry, and understand the sacrifice required in getting there.

What It Takes will explore the many opportunities available, from working in fashion via runway or editorial hair and makeup to onset professionals in film and television who use their talents to create believable characters through hair design, makeup, and special FX. Every effort by these professionals is essential to the success of the project they are supporting. Each of these career paths is somewhat different, yet all require one essential quality to reach the goal: Passion.

      <h1>
        About the Director
      </h1>

<p>
“My name is Amber Talarico, director/executive producer of What It Takes. I am a working freelance hair and makeup artist for film and fashion in Los Angeles, California. A year and a half ago, I came up with the idea to create a documentary based on what the reality is behind what we do as freelance artists. My biggest piece of advice is to follow your dreams, but know what it takes to get there. Many people assume that it is a glamorous job, that it’s easy, or even looked down upon as a career…almost as if it were the ‘easy way out.’ Normally you see successful artists give tips and tricks, behind the scenes photos, and the celebrity stylists hanging out with their high profile clientele. But what has never been visually exposed is just HOW hard the process is to get to those points in our careers-if you do in fact get there. All of us on this journey, whether currently facing the challenges of the climb or having finally reached the pinnacle, can attest to the difficulty that is faced along the way. My desire is for this documentary to highlight the hard work that is not seen or talked about in the magazines, media, or blogs that most people follow.”

From a young age, Amber displayed a natural propensity for risk taking. She exhibited little fear growing up when it came to doing things that required a sense of bravado, whether navigating the top bar of a swing set at the age of three or standing up for herself and others in the face of undue criticism or harassment. Her strong work ethic began at age 14 when she got her first job and kept it for over two years before moving to the next place of employment. She learned discipline, self-sacrifice, and the importance of teamwork as a 4-year member of her high school drum line and has always marched to the proverbial beat of a different drum. She has a passion and enthusiasm for life that is infectious and never shrinks from taking the first step in establishing relationships. All of these qualities is evident in the approach she takes to achieving her goals and dreams in her career as well as in directing What It Takes.
